Hello. My name is Denis, a.k.a. Denko. I am passionate about creating Magento 2 web stores. I have 20+ years of experience in IT, have worked with the LAMP stack since 2005, and have been actively working on Magento 2 since 2019. You can find my full curriculum vitae (CV) at the following link: [_CV-Europass-20230727-D.Aleksandrov-EN-Magento-Skills-5p.pdf](https://github.com/denal05/denal05.github.io/blob/main/_CV-Europass-20230727-D.Aleksandrov-EN-Magento-Skills-5p.pdf)

Allow me to tell you about a couple of projects.

The first project I'd like to present to you is Zazu:  
[https://codewellgroup.com/zazu](https://codewellgroup.com/zazu)  
The client's goal for this project was to create a new online shopping experience for parents to buy children's clothes, toys, and gifts. The project comprises a web store and a special Event Organizer for various children's events. It is also designed as a community where parents, relatives, and friends can share experiences and learn from each other to find and buy the best for their children.
The system is made of a Magento 2 store, and a web app interfaced with Magento. The Magento store sells children's toys, clothes, accessories, etc. The web app enables parents to organize children's birthday parties with products from the Magento store.

The Magento store sells paper books and eBooks. The mobile apps enable buying and reading eBooks from the Magento 2 store.

A little bit about my background. I spent ten years in the USA. First, I obtained a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science in Oklahoma in 2005. I took the test and became a Sun Certified Java Programmer in 2006. Next, I obtained a Master’s degree in Electrical Engineering in California in 2008, concentrating on Embedded Systems Engineering. 

I came back to my home country North Macedonia in 2009. I worked at Seavus as a junior Embedded Software Engineer/Tester for two years, developing telecommunications firmware. Next, I worked at INform as a project manager in 2011 for seven years, a small company that celebrated its 20th birthday in 2018. INform needed a project manager for their contract with IntriCon, a USA company based in Minnesota that had just started to design their first holter (heart monitor) device. They outsourced INform to develop the complete software solution (firmware, desktop app, web app, iOS app), QA, and FDA 510(k) regulatory compliance documentation. The 2-year project turned into a 6-year project, and IntriCon was so happy with us that their project manager wrote us a recommendation letter that is available upon request. I also maintained the code for the iOS app that communicated with the embedded systems medical device via Bluetooth Low Energy. I managed and executed tests via TestFlight. I also wrote a WordPress plugin to replace TestFlight via ad-hoc distribution using the ITMS-services protocol. 

From 2019 to 2021, I worked as a full-stack Magento 2 developer at CodeWell, an award-winning company that specializes in chatbots and also creates innovative solutions by combining different technologies with proprietary middleware. Ever since, I've been subcontracting/freelancing for various international companies as a backend Magento 2 developer, working from home.
 
From February to June 2023 I was a Backend Magento 2 developer for NTT Data Spain. I worked on a project for their client Orange Belgium. I was coding modules according to user stories and providing defect fixes in staging and production environments. I worked extensively on "bulk order status update" functionality and Algolia integration. Also, I worked on the "onepage" checkout customization. Please check the recommendation I received from the tech lead on my LinkedIn profile: https://www.linkedin.com/in/denal05

My mission is to make a difference, to grow in character, and to seize the day!

I am looking forward to hearing from you.

Sincerely,
