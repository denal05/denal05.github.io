Hi, my name is Denis. I'm a Magento developer from North Macedonia, educated in the USA, and I'm usually hired as a remote contractor. I have over 25 years of experience in IT, out of which seven were as a project manager. I've worked with the LAMP stack since 2005, and I've been actively working on Magento 2 since 2019. You can find my full curriculum vitae (CV) at the following link: [_CV-ATS-2025-02-12-D-Aleksandrov-EN-Magento-4p.pdf](https://github.com/denal05/denal05.github.io/blob/main/_CV-ATS-2025-02-12-D-Aleksandrov-EN-Magento-4p.pdf)

Allow me to share about a couple of projects.

The first project I'd like to present to you is [Zazu](https://web.archive.org/web/20220416060149/https://codewellgroup.com/zazu)  
Zazu is an online shop for children's products. The project comprises a Magento 2 shop, and an event organizer web app, written in Angular.js and interfaced with the Magento shop. The Magento shop handles the sales, shipping, and invoices. On the other hand, the event organizer web app enables parents to organize children's birthday parties with products from the Magento shop.

The second project is [Kniga (Book)](https://web.archive.org/web/20220416060153/https://codewellgroup.com/kniga)  
Kniga is an ecosystem for selling, buying, reading, and reviewing printed books and eBooks made for TRI Publishing House. The entire ecosystem consists of a Magento 2 store, native Android and iOS mobile apps, and an admin panel web app. The mobile apps are loosely coupled to the Magento 2 store via Firebase. The Magento 2 store sells paper books and eBooks; the mobile apps enable buying and reading eBooks from the Magento 2 store.
My Magento 2 work in this project involved the following:
- Payment Gateway Integration
- Firebase Integration
- Google Analytics Integration
- SMTP Integration
- OpenGraph Integration
- Facebook Authentication Integration
- Mailchimp Integration
- Custom REST APIs
- CRON Jobs Configuration
- Tax Configuration
- Email Template Configuration
- Localization (i18n)
- Marketing and Transactional Email Templates
- Custom Events and Observers
- Custom Plugins
- Custom Logs
- Custom Layout and Frontend Templates
- Custom Magento Admin Panel Config Parameters
- Custom Shipping Modules
- Custom Cash-On-Delivery Payment Method
- Custom Magento Repositories
- CRUD Functionality

I spent ten years in the USA. During this time, I obtained a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science in Oklahoma in 2005, and a Master’s degree in Electrical Engineering in California in 2008, concentrating on Embedded Systems Engineering. 

I came back to my home country North Macedonia in 2009. I worked at Seavus as a junior Embedded Software Engineer/Tester for two years, developing telecommunications firmware. Next, I worked at INform as a project manager in 2011 for seven years, a small company that celebrated its 20th birthday in 2018. INform needed a project manager for their contract with IntriCon, a USA company based in Minnesota that had just started to design their first holter (heart monitor) device. They outsourced INform to develop the complete software solution (firmware, desktop app, web app, iOS app), QA, and FDA 510(k) regulatory compliance documentation. The 2-year project turned into a 6-year project, and IntriCon was so happy with us that their project manager wrote us a recommendation letter that is available upon request. I also maintained the code for the iOS app that communicated with the embedded systems medical device via Bluetooth Low Energy. I managed and executed tests via TestFlight. I also wrote a WordPress plugin to replace TestFlight via ad-hoc distribution using the ITMS-services protocol. 

From 2019 to 2021, I worked as a full-stack Magento 2 developer at CodeWell, an award-winning company that specializes in chatbots and also creates innovative solutions by combining different technologies with proprietary middleware. 

In 2021 I self-employed. Ever since, I've been subcontracting/freelancing for various international companies as a backend Magento 2 developer, working from home. This has been very beneficial for my family because our younger boy has Down syndrome and is also legally blind.
 
From February to June 2023, I was a Backend Magento 2 developer for NTT Data Spain. I worked on a project for their client Orange Belgium. I coded modules according to user stories and provided defect fixes in staging and production environments. I worked extensively on the "bulk order status update" functionality and Algolia integration. Also, I customized the "onepage" checkout. Please check the recommendation I received from the tech lead on my LinkedIn profile: [https://www.linkedin.com/in/denal05](https://www.linkedin.com/in/denal05)

From November 2023 to August 2024 I worked as a Magento 2 developer at Syncit Group in Serbia, remotely. I upgraded the Magento websites of existing production environments from 2.3 and 2.4 to 2.6 and 2.7. Also, I created various Docker environments for Magento 2. A big part of my job was detecting and removing malware. Lastly, I customized the classic Magento 2 checkout that comes with the Luma theme.

In the meantime, I've been studying for the AD0-E702 certification: [Adobe Certified Professional - Adobe Commerce Developer](https://express.adobe.com/page/ClHLYMaUjTUfa/). To achieve that. I've enrolled in the [SwiftOtter](https://learning.swiftotter.com/) and [M.academy](https://m.academy/) schools. I even sparked a good discussion on [Campus](https://campus.m.academy/), the premium community for Magento developers, which led Mark Shust to write an excellent article: [The Unexpected Behavior of Magento Plugin Execution Order](https://m.academy/articles/magento-plugin-execution-order/).    

My mission is to make a difference, to grow in character, and to seize the day!

Let me know how I can help.

Sincerely,
